# Decentralized Freelance Content Creation Platform

A blockchain-based platform connecting content creators with clients through smart contracts, ensuring transparent, secure, and efficient content marketplace operations.

## Overview

This platform revolutionizes content creation freelancing by leveraging blockchain technology to create a trustless ecosystem where creators and clients can collaborate seamlessly. The platform consists of four main smart contracts that handle different aspects of the content creation lifecycle.

## Core Components

### Content Creator Contract

### Commission Contract
- Content request submissions
- Project scope definition
- Milestone tracking
- Deliverable management
- Payment escrow services
- Review and feedback system

### Rights Management Contract
- Content licensing configuration
- Usage rights tracking
- Rights transfer management
- Royalty distribution
- Copyright protection
- Secondary market management

### Dispute Resolution Contract
- Conflict mediation system
- Evidence submission and review
- Arbitration process management
- Resolution enforcement
- Appeals handling
- Penalty implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0 or higher)
- Hardhat
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- IPFS node (for content storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/decentralized-freelance-platform.git
cd decentralized-freelance-platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Compile smart contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

5. Deploy contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
```

## Usage

### For Content Creators

1. Create a profile:
```solidity
await ContentCreatorContract.createProfile(
    name,
    skills,
    portfolioIPFSHash
);
```

2. Accept commissions:
```solidity
await CommissionContract.acceptProject(
    projectId,
    deliveryTimeline,
    milestones
);
```

### For Clients

1. Submit content requests:
```solidity
await CommissionContract.createProject(
    description,
    budget,
    deadline,
    requirements
);
```

2. Review and accept deliverables:
```solidity
await CommissionContract.acceptDeliverable(
    projectId,
    deliverableId
);
```

## Security Considerations

- All smart contracts are audited by independent security firms
- Multi-signature wallet implementation for platform upgrades
- Time-locked execution for critical operations
- Emergency pause functionality
- Regular security assessments and updates
